Wikipedia: Reliable Sources tables on wikipedia
* RS:P (global perennial sources) -- the english-language version is included as a NewsQ source.  Many other languages exist.
* [New Pages Patrol Source Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPPSG) (used by new page patrollers)
* topical Reliable Sources lists -- dozens in English alone.

Wikidata: there are few scattered source-reliablity assessments referenced on Wikidata. A recent discussion about how to add these programmatically led to the fledgling [Credibility Ratings + Assessments Project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:CRAP).
